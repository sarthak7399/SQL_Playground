-- +----------+-------------+
-- | visit_id | customer_id |
-- +----------+-------------+
-- | 1        | 23          |
-- | 2        | 9           |
-- | 4        | 30          |

-- Transactions
-- +----------------+----------+--------+
-- | transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
-- +----------------+----------+--------+
-- | 2              | 5        | 310    |

-- | customer_id | count_no_trans |
-- +-------------+----------------+
-- | 54          | 2              |

-- Explanation: 
-- Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
-- Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
-- Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
-- Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
-- Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
-- As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

-- Method 1
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;

-- Method 2
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(visit_id) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits
WHERE visit_id NOT IN (SELECT visit_id FROM Transactions)
GROUP BY customer_id

-- Method 3
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(visit_id) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits
LEFT JOIN Transactions
USING(visit_id)
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id
